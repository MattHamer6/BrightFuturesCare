# Bright Futures Care
## https://brightfuturescare.co.uk/

A bespoke WordPress theme built to be as easy to use as possible for the client with the help of a page builder, and multiple unique blocks. 

## Technologies Used:
* HTML5
* SCSS/SASS
* JavaScript/jQuery
* PHP
* WordPress

## Notes:
On top of the website build I had to make this website as accessible as possible due to it being for a charity - this meant I had to create a way for users to be able to modify the font-sizes of certain aspects of the site, this was done using JavaScript - and saving the choice as a cookie in the browser.
